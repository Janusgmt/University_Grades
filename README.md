# University_Grades

Most companies look at the gpa when hiring recent grads or poeple with little industry experience.
This Project is my attemt to show how bad the Data Quality of university grades really are, and that more focus should lie on actual practical experience.

I will use this Project not only to give some context on my grades and gpa but to prove my claim from earlier.

I will use assumtions during this project which are based on my experiences from university, school and experiences from friends which accumulated over the years.

Some general conditions are:
- I went to a German University 
- My highest degree is an Bachelor of Science
- My university course was informatics

With that out of the way i want to start by mentioning a few facs which make grades a nearly worthless indicator as its used now a days.

Factors which influenece university grades:
- Professor teaching quality
- Exam Type (Project vs timed exam)
- Evaluation of Projects where only teamgrades are given (grades for teams)
- Exam difficulty (gpa of all students)
- Professor correcting stlye
- 

So now that there are some influences mentioned its important to evaluate what big of an influence they realy make.

But could a gpa still be used, by changing the way its treated?
Yes absolutly... in theory.
While there is no dought that having a consistent high gpa its a sign of commitment.

Grades could still be used with a high quality when comparing the grades of someone with other people from the same University, the same course from the same
professor during a limited timeframe.

That way we use the peer comparison and eliminate many of the mentioned influences on Data quality.
